## Call for Pull Requests

It turns out that building pjsip library for iOS is not a trivial task. Since pjsip binaries has to be rebuild from time to time to automate this work I've decided to create bash scripts and share my work with a community. 

It's just my private initiative and I want to state this as clear as possible that this is not an official repository. 

I've finished developing my pjsip application, thats why I'm no longer interested in supporting this repository. But I know there are some people which relies on it. They may have buildtime and runtime issues which I'm not able to debug and investigate. 

If you are a kind of a person that have time and will to fix and update this build scripts, and experienced enough to debug issues, please send me your pull requests — you will be more than welcome.
